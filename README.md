# My Frogger Clone - Bug Splat
## Instructions

### It's simple really ...

* Get the gems.  Get them to the princess
* Beware of the enemy bugs in the way
* Don't even think of getting to the princess without a gem
* TODO - If you fall in the water you spill the gem. Back to the start with you.

* Left/right/up/down keys to move your would be bug prince

* Hitting any key during the intro or gameover sequences will restart the game

* Oh and if you hate the music, I've left you a button at the bottom to turn it off.  Don't say I don't do anything for you
